I\u2019m sure there have been occasions where Sir Keir has said things to himself in the shaving mirror about Mr Trump that he would not wish to be repeated. But he is an example of how to handle Donald Trump. It is infinitely better than challenging Trump\u2019s ego, to which there is no limit, trying to work around him.</p><p>And up to now, the Starmer approach to Trump has succeeded, not least in the fact that, until this latest outburst on Greenland, we did have a much better deal on tariffs than, say, the European Union has had.</p><p>The treaty has been signed with the Mauritian government. So I can\u2019t reverse the clock on that. The treaty has been signed. Parliament has a kind of enabling function on treaties. It\u2019s not like a traditional piece of legislation.
