Over the last three days it has been hard to find anyone in British politics willing to defend the US raid on Venezuela leading to the capture of its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In the Commons last night, Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, engaged in a delicate balancing act \u2013 stressing the UK\u2019s support for international law, while doing her best not to criticise the fairly blatant US breach of it \u2013 as MPs from all the main parties lined up to demand a more robust pushback against Donald Trump.</p><p>Venezuela was a brutal regime. We didn\u2019t even recognise it as a legitimate government. I think that what\u2019s happened is quite extraordinary. But I understand why America has done it.</p><p>And the reason why I say this is because, where the legal certainty is not yet clear, morally I do think it was the right thing to do.</p><p>I grew up under a military dictatorship [in Nigeria], so I know what it\u2019s like to have someone like Maduro in charge. I know what it\u2019s like to have people celebrating in the street. So I\u2019m not condemning the US.</p><p>As we all know, international law is what countries agree to. Once people decide they don\u2019t agree, there is no international law. There\u2019s no world police, no world government, no world court. These are agreements.</p><p>And when we look at what the opposition leader, Mar\u00eda Machado, said, she said Venezuela had already been invaded. It had been invaded by Russia, by Iran, by Hezbollah. Where were the people talking about international law then?</p><p>The US has actually been saying this for a very long time. I remember as trade secretary, the US has basically walked away from the World Trade Organization saying that everybody else was breaking the rules, China in particular, and if people weren\u2019t following the rules, there was no rules-based order.</p><p>And we go through the motions, we act as if it is still 1995, we were living off the peace dividend of the cold war and World War Two.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/jan/06/badenoch-trump-venezuela-maduro-starmer-streeting-uk-politics-latest-news-updates\">Continue reading...</a>",
