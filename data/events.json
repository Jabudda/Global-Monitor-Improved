The party that previously held the seat gets to move the writ for a byelection and governing parties facing a difficult byelection sometimes go for a quick contest so that challenger parties, which might not be well organised in the seat and short of voter data, don\u2019t have time to bed in and build up momentum.</p><p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> has defended the decision not to allow Andy Burnham to stand to be Labour\u2019s candidate in the Gorton and Denton byelection. Starmer was on the 10-strong panel that took the near-unanimous decision to block Burnham yesterday, and, speaking to broadcasters today, he set out the same argument used by Douglas Alexander earlier.
