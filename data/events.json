President Herzog will also conduct interviews with the media during the visit.</p><p>That\u2019s a really distorted figure. And why I say that is that figure comes across 150 electorates from around the country. And as Nationals, we only stand in about 20 to 30 seats. So we don\u2019t run in any city seats. [In] a lot of cities, we wouldn\u2019t poll at all. We\u2019d poll zero in Wentworth. We\u2019d poll zero in Kooyong. We\u2019d poll zero in Perth because we don\u2019t stand candidates there.</p><p>One Nation aren\u2019t a regional party. I mean, One Nation are running across every seat across the whole country. So I mean it\u2019s not even comparable in that sense. But you know obviously their figures have gone up very much since post-Bondi, and that has to be noted.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2026/feb/09/anthony-albanese-sussan-ley-labor-liberal-national-coalition-israel-president-arrives-sydney-melbourne-protests-vic-nsw-qld-ntwnfb\">Continue reading...</a>",
