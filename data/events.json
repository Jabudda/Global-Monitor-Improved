      "summary": "<p>Anas Sarwar said that he stood by what he said when he announced on Monday that he wanted the prime minister to stand down</p><p>The <strong>Equality and Human Rights Commission</strong> <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/media-centre/news/comment-judicial-review-brought-good-law-project\">has welcomed</a> a high court ruling defending the interim guidance it issued to organisations about the implications of the supreme court judgement saying that, when the Equality Act refers to sex, it means biological sex.</p><p>The guidance \u2013 described as an \u201cinterim update\u201d \u2013 was controversial because it was seen as over-prescriptive, and the Good Law Project launched a legal challenge.</p><p>We welcome the court\u2019s conclusion that the interim update was lawful and the EHRC did not act in breach of its statutory duties.</p><p>We issued the interim update in response to a high level of demand immediately after the supreme court\u2019s ruling. We were concerned that organisations and individuals could be subject to misinformation and misrepresentation of the judgment and its consequences. That might have led to them failing to comply with the law: adopting or maintaining discriminatory policies or practices, to the detriment of those the law is supposed to protect.</p><p>It is wrong because it reduces trans people to a third sex. It is wrong because it gives little or no weight to the harm done to trans people by excluding them. And it is wrong because it is not interested enough in the rights of people who are trans to keep their status private.</p><p>The tragic irony for [Morgan] McSweeney [Starmer\u2019s chief of staff until Sunday] was that Starmer\u2019s 18 months as prime minister have only vindicated Blair\u2019s central analysis of their project. McSweeney and Starmer might have identified what they disliked most about the excesses of New Labour, but they never developed an alternative political economy of their own that might replace it. In place of Blairism there was no theory of political reform or coherent critique of British state failure, no analysis of Britain\u2019s future place in the world or any kind of distinct moral mission. All there was was a promise to \u201cclean things up\u201d as Starmer put it to me. The mission became, in essence, conservative: to protect the settlement erected by Blair and eroded over the 20 years since his departure. Britain could thrive if it could only begin to live within its means, attract more foreign investment, reassure the bond markets and return a sense of \u201cservice\u201d to government. After years of chaos, mere stability would be change. And this would be enough.</p><p>Where there was distinct radicalism \u2013 from McSweeney\u2019s Blue Labour instincts \u2013 there was no mandate. McSweeney and Starmer had not fought an ideological battle to bring Blue Labour to government, as Wilson had done for socialist modernisation in the 1960s and Blair for liberal progressivism 30 years later. This was largely because Starmer never really believed in it in the first place and McSweeney, though a reflective thinker, was always more of an operator than political theorist. And so, the pair offered a programme without a programme, a government without ideas or the mandate to enact them.</p><p>Another of those who worked for [Stamer] adds: \u2018He\u2019s completely incurious. He\u2019s not interested in policy or politics. He thinks his job is to sit in a room and be serious, be presented with something and say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d \u2013 invariably \u201cYes\u201d \u2013 rather than be persuader\u2013in-chief.\u2019 Even before he fell out with Starmer, Mandelson told friends and colleagues that the Prime Minister had never once asked him \u2018What really makes Trump tick?\u2019 or \u2018How will he react to this?\u2019.</p><p>Others dispute the claim of incuriosity. \u2018There are subjects when he drills down and he\u2019s really, really good,\u2019 says another aide. \u2018The idea he can\u2019t think politically is also wrong. He will often think ahead.\u2019 But even these loyalists admit Starmer lacks a \u2018philosophical worldview\u2019.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/feb/13/keir-starmer-cabinet-secretary-chris-wormald-labour-badenoch-conservatives-uk-latest-news-updates\">Continue reading...</a>",
